            <h2>Interviews:</h2>
            <p>Here are our interviews with some notable figures at Kalamazoo College regarding accesibility.</p>

            <h2>Interview With Dana Jansma, Associate Dean of Students:</h2>

            <div id="content" style="display: none;">
                <p>Jansma, as the Associate Dean of Students, works with students who need accommodations, students if they need to withdraw or take medical leave, and students who are struggling for various reasons.  “I help support students and get them linked to appropriate resources,” said Jansma. After students file for an accommodation, she works with students on a one-on-one basis, talking through the students’ issues, struggles, and the accommodations they need. Reasonable accommodation depends on the student; a student who broke their leg does not need extra time on a test, but they would need help getting around campus, thus someone driving them to classes may be granted as an accommodation. Jansma also informs the professors of accommodations students require and how they can implement that in the classroom. Professors are not required to know what disability the student has, but it is the responsibility of the student to communicate with their professors on when they will need those accommodations.</p>
                <p>If an individual has mobility challenges, “this is a very challenging campus because we’re built on a hill. Navigating this campus can be challenging.” The construction of a ramp in the quad would result in the paving of the whole quad, cost thousands of dollars and be very time consuming, “It’s not something that can happen right away, so we have to find ways that work within our existing systems,” said Jansma.</p>
                <p>The residences are incredibly old, –Trowbridge was built in 1920s– and were built under different regulations – that is why many of the residences and buildings are inaccessible. Adding elevators to these buildings will be extremely costly. Therefore, as Kalamazoo College constructs new residential buildings, elevators will be added to the buildings, and they will be constructed to make them more accessible. A major obstacle in making K more accessible to people with mobility is that the campus is situated on a hill.</p>
                <p>Jansma partnered with Alumni Engagement and Facilities Management to buy the wheelchair mat used for events on campus. “I find it easy to work with othe r departments on campus, at the core everyone wants the students to be successful,” said Jansma. Financial challenges are major limitations on making the campus more accessible, especially during college-wide budget cuts.</p>
                <p>If an individual has complaints about the accessibility of the campus, they should contact Tanya Jachimiak, the section 504 coordinator of Kalamazoo College. “There may be remedies and we can do that way quicker, like if the office of civil rights received a complaint, it could be years before they get to it,” said Jansma. “Please come to me, or if a person has general campus concerns, go to Tanya,” added Jansma.</p>
